# matplotlib
This is the Module 5 Challenge focusing on matplotlib in the 2024 Data Science and Analytics Bootcamp

Posing as a senior data analyst at the fictitious pharmaceutical company Pymaceuticals, Inc. that specializes in anti-cancer medications, I was tasked with observing several drug regimens in 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors over the course of 45 days. “The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.”

Over the course of this module and challenge, I learned and improved upon plotting several kinds of charts over several libraries, including matplotlib, seaborn, and scikitlearn. This was an exciting part of the boot camp to be able to final visualize data to do better analysis and predictions. Learning linear regressions and basic statistics was also crucial in being able to definitely show correlation.
